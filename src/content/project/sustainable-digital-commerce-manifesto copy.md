## Eco digital commerce manifesto

In a future liberated from profit-driven imperatives, online commerce will center on human needs, collective ownership, and equitable distribution. This new digital economy will move beyond private interests, instead fostering a cooperative, community-centered model. Technology will become a tool for collective benefit, managed democratically by communities and serving to meet social needs, protect the environment, and prioritize human dignity over profit.

## Collective Ownership and Democratic Control

In this vision of online commerce, digital platforms are publicly owned and governed by the people. Instead of monopolistic corporations dictating terms, commerce platforms will be operated by cooperatives and community councils, giving workers and communities the power to shape their own economic futures. Decision-making will be transparent and democratic, ensuring that resources are directed where they are truly needed. By centering public ownership, the surplus created by workers will return to them in the form of improved services, fair compensation, and community enrichment.

## Technology as a Tool for Society

Technology in this future is liberated from the demands of corporate profit and serves humanity as a whole. Artificial intelligence, automation, and data analytics—currently deployed to maximize profits and drive consumerism—will instead be used to reduce waste, allocate resources effectively, and improve lives. Technology will make commerce more efficient without promoting overconsumption, empowering people to access goods in ways that are sustainable and fair. Algorithms will support ethical planning, reduce waste, and ensure that resources are allocated according to real needs.

## Worker Empowerment and the End of Exploitation

Workers, who sustain and shape the economy, will have direct control over their labor and a fair share in its rewards. In this future, the rights, safety, and well-being of all workers—from manufacturing to technology development—will be paramount. Every worker will earn fair wages, and workplaces will be safe, collaborative, and democratically managed. Automation will reduce the burden of repetitive tasks, giving workers more time for self-development and community engagement. In this system, workers are no longer alienated from their labor; they are co-owners of the economy they sustain.

## Planned Production for Sustainability

Instead of chasing endless growth, this digital economy will rely on planned production, meeting genuine needs rather than creating unnecessary demand. Data-driven insights will help society produce only what is necessary, minimizing waste, conserving resources, and honoring the ecological limits of our planet. Production will be aligned with social and environmental needs rather than market demands, creating a sustainable system that supports collective well-being rather than catering to narrow interests.

## Global Solidarity and Cooperation

In place of corporate monopolies and fierce competition, online commerce will be grounded in global cooperation and solidarity. Digital platforms will foster the equitable exchange of goods and resources among nations, supporting self-sufficiency while strengthening international bonds. This new model will prioritize mutual aid and solidarity, empowering all regions to engage in commerce without fear of exploitation or domination. The internet, once a tool of corporate influence, will instead become a network of unity, providing access to the resources needed to build a fair and equitable global economy.

## Conscious Consumption and Responsible Choices

Without the pressures of consumerist advertising, people will engage in commerce thoughtfully, guided by need and purpose rather than manufactured desire. Digital commerce platforms will prioritize transparent information, helping individuals make choices that are beneficial to themselves, their communities, and the environment. By focusing on what is necessary and useful, society will move toward sustainable consumption, where quality, durability, and shared access are more important than quantity and excess. This approach will nurture a culture of responsible consumption, creating a balanced relationship between people and the planet.

## Toward a Classless, Equitable Digital Economy

The ultimate goal of this vision is a classless society where the digital economy serves everyone equitably. Each person contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs, fostering a global community where dignity, transparency, and collective well-being are central. Online commerce platforms will reflect this commitment to equality, making way for a world where every individual has the opportunity to live a fulfilling life.

In this future, online commerce will no longer be a tool of inequality and exploitation. It will become a means to meet human needs, nurture solidarity, and build a sustainable world where all people have the freedom to live with purpose, dignity, and connection.
