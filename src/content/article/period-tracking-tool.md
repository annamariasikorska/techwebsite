So far, when it comes to menstruation tracking, I was dependent only on a traditional calendar where I'd mark the first day of the menstruation cycle. It had its flaws because all the data was kind of lost or forgotten after each calendar change.
Over the many years, I ended up without any reliable information about the average period length, pms sympoms, any anomalies in recent years. 
There was a short period of time in my life when I used period-tracking apps, but I decided that I don't want to share my personal health data with any company. As I'm learning Python, I started developing my own tool, fully personalized to my needs and, most importantly, where I am the only owner of my personal data.

## For now, my needs are:
I want to know which day of the menstruation cycle I am on
I want to know in which phase of the cycle I am
I want to know the average cycle length based on recent data
And in this iteration, my tool is serving its purpose.

## As I'm learning Python, I want to point out the concepts I've used in this project:
Basic Syntax - Variables, constants, loops, conditionals
Functions - Definitions, parameters, return values, docstrings
Error Handling - Try-except block
Data Structures - Lists, list comprehensions
Date Handling - datetime, parsing, formatting, date math
User Input - input() function
String Manipulation - f-strings, formatting
Control Flow - If-else, loops, main guard ( if __name__ == "__main__")

## Next iteration:
Store data in SQLite
Create GUI (Tkinter)
To add information about moon phases
Add predictions & visualisations
Exporting/Importing data for backup (on my own server?)
To package it as a desktop app
